1) Files

README                This file

mapc_poly_main.cc     A sample file to use MAPC
mapc_sturm_main.cc    A sample file to use MAPC
mapc_pt1_main.cc      A sample file to use MAPC
mapc_main.cc          A sample file to use MAPC

esolid_main.cc        A sample file to use ESOLID

In the rest of this file, ${ESOLID_dir} refers to the installation
directory, the parent directory where you are now.

2) MAPC

MAPC is a library for efficient exact manipulation of algebraic points
and curves.

To build the archive of the object files, go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make libmapc

2-1) mapc_poly_main.cc

This file contains the source codes to build the executable "mapc_poly".
To build the executable "esolid", go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make mapc_poly

This file contains several examples to use MAPC to perform arithmetic
operations over the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients.

2-2) mapc_sturm_main.cc

This file contains the source codes to build the executable "mapc_sturm".
To build the executable "esolid", go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make mapc_sturm

This file contains several examples to use MAPC to compute the roots
of a given univariate polynomial with rational coefficients by Sturm
sequence method.

2-3) mapc_pt1_main.cc

This file contains the source codes to build the executable "mapc_pt1".
To build the executable "esolid", go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make mapc_pt1

This file contains several examples to use MAPC to perform arithmetic
operations over 1-dimensional algebraic numbers.

2-4) mapc_main.cc

This file contains the source codes to build the executable "mapc".
To build the executable "esolid", go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make mapc

This file contains several examples to use MAPC.

3) ESOLID

ESOLID is a system for performing exact boundary evaluation of
low-degree curves solids.

3-1) esolid_main.cc

This file contains the source codes to build the executable "esolid".
To build the executable "esolid", go to ${ESOLID_dir} and type

  make esolid

or simply

  make

The usage is "esolid" is as follows:

  usage: esolid [operation] infile1 [infile2] [outfile]
  operations:
    -M  perform a multilevel operation rooted at the directory infile1
    -U  perform a union between infile1 and infile2, output to outfile.
    -I  perfom an intersection between infile1 and infile2, output to outfile.
    -D  perform a difference of infile1 minus infile2, output to outfile.
    -O  output the solid given in infile1 to outfile (do not specify infile2).

  example:

    ${ESOLID_dir}/esolid -U ${ESOLID_dir}/desolid/boxinp1
                            ${ESOLID_dir}/desolid/boxinp2
                            ${ESOLID_dir}/bez/box1Ubox2.bez
