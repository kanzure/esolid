2) Installation

2-1) Platforms

ESOLID Version 0.3 has been tested on

  Linux Fedora Core 5 and  g++ 4.1.0

on Intel x86 CPU's.

2-2) Prerequisite Libraries

To build and run ESOLID Version 0.3, the GNU MP (gmp) and LAPACK
(clapack) are required.

2-2-1) The GNU MP (gmp)

The GNU MP (gmp) 4.0 or later must be pre-installed on your
machine. For more information, visit the GNU MP homepage:

     http://www.swox.com/gmp/

The compiled binaries for Fedora Core 5 on Intel x86 CPU's is available at

     http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/5/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/gmp-4.1.4-6.2.1.i386.rpm
     http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/5/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/gmp-devel-4.1.4-6.2.1.i386.rpm

We assume the header file

     gmp.h

is located at

     /usr/include

and the archive

     libgmp.a or libgmp.so

at

     /usr/lib.

If the name and/or location of any of those is different, edit Makefile and
correct it.

2-2-2) LAPACK (CLAPACK)

To build and run ESOLID Version 0.3, CLAPCK must be pre-installed
on your machine.

LAPCK is originally written in FORTRAN. CLAPACK is a version of
LAPACK written in C. For more information, visit CLAPACK homepage:

     http://www.netlib.org/clapack/index.html

2-2-2-1) BLAS is required to run CLAPACK. If BLAS is not present
         on your machine, then build and use "cblas", that is contained
         in the source code of "clapack". Note that the performance
         of CLAPACK, and ESOLID, as well, largely depends on the performance
         of the BLAS library.

2-2-2-2) Please, download the source code of "clapack" from

            http://www.netlib.org/clapack/index.html

         and build it.

We assume the archives

    libclapack.a
    libF77.a

are located at /usr/local/lib. If the name and/or location of any of
those is different, edit Makefile and correct it.

2-3) Installation

2-3-1) De-archive ESOLID-0.3.tar.gz by

            gzip -cd ESOLID-0.3.tar.gz | tar -xf -

       and you will have the directory ESOLID. Move there by

            cd ESOLID.

2-3-2) Look at

            Makefile
            Makefile.flags
            Makefile.system

       and modify them if necessarily. Also, look at

            include/config.h
            src/config.cc

       and modify them if necessarily.

2-3-2) To make binary for the complete ESOLID binary, "esolid", simply type

            make

       or

            make esolid.

       To make binary for the MAPC binary, "mapc", type

            make mapc.
